- This folder contains all the cuts (Bender's cuts) resulting from previous training sessions of the model, for each cost case presented in the paper.\\
Results files are also present: 
- base_objective_BESS_XX.csv show the investment levels for when the cost assumption for BESS is the baseline assumption scaled by XX.
- base_objective_H2_XX.csv show the investment levels for when the cost assumption for H2 is the baseline assumption scaled by XX.
